Welcome to the repository for non-minified JavaScript files of our WordPress plugin, AI Power.

As per the guidelines of WordPress plugin development, we have provided access to these files for developers and users alike to be able to view and understand the raw, human-readable JavaScript code that powers our plugin.

In this repository, you'll find all JavaScript files that are included in our plugin in their original, non-minified form.

This is to ensure that we are transparent about our code, and to give all users the opportunity to understand and contribute to its development.
